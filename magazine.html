      <p>
        This project was created in the course IAT 102: Graphic Design.
        To practice setting type and imagery, our team were assigned to create a printed magazine layout.
        We decided to look into the fashion trend and we picked “denim” for our magazine spread — “Denim is the New Black”.
        As the art director, my role in this project was to generate and gather possible ideations,
        take major design decision and provided technical supports.
      </p>

      <h4>Intention</h4>
      <p>We chose denim, as we believed the texture itself potentially give much visual
        experience to the audience from our greyscale magazine spread. Denim had much variety
        and possibilities that being displayed in our spread. Moreover, we intended to play with lines,
        polygons and irregular shapes to create some energy and dynamics in our spread.

      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>The most challenging part of this project is to generate a unify and strong art direction from our different spreads,
        aesthetic judgment was the major problem that we faced.  For the final step of our project,
        I suggested to combine our visual elements into different versions to test the possible
        outcomes of pages (see images below). By concerning the audience and effectiveness,
        we asked for feedback from different stakeholders like instructors and peers to unify our
        ideas. This provided flexibility and made a balance of the extremes in our group.
        Moreover, I edited the photos in the same gradient level to increase the consistency of our work.

      <h4>Outcomes</h4>
      <p>The project was a triumph. In this project, I learnt the importance of balancing various
        opinions when leading a team. Instead of overly disputing the appealing of design at first,
        generate more ideas might give a better result. Massive ideation could bring greater flexibility and
        creativity to the product. Although it might be time consuming, testing out different possibilities
        before observing the results always works better in a team.
