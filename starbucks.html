          This project is created in the course IAT 339: Web Design and Development.
          In a team of two, we chose Starbucks Reserve as our simulated client and re-designed the webpage for them.
          Considering the brand identity, online customers, persona, colour palette, font choices, and responsive structure,
          we created style guide, interactive elements for the pages and finally consolidated them in our webpage.

        <h4>Intention</h4>
        <p>
          The colour of black and gold give a connection of the in storeâ€™s interiors to the online customers.
          The combination of these two colours also make the page stand out from the usual Starbucks website.
          By targeting the young adult, the website is intended to create a modern,
          luxury and delightful experience to our users.

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The most challenging part in this project was the advanced communication through Github.
          Since it was the first time learning Github, we spent a lot of time to figure how it works and how to avoid the duplication when staging our files.
          Role division would be the essential part before using Github. We usually worked in different parts in the pages not only to avoid jamming and confusion due to the software,
          but it also reduce any conflicts about the design decisions that we made.
        </p><br>

        <h4>Outcomes</h4>
        <p>The learning and usage of Github was the most significant part for me in this project.
          Although it was a confusion and it was hard to master it at the beginning,
          it provided much convenience for our team project that we could work individually and effectively.
          Without any time constraint, Github was a great platform to the success of our website.
